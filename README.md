## The Problem

Sudoku is an amazing puzzle game that worth wasting you hours playing it. I've been playing sudoku for years now but I wasn't able to find any good online environment to play it.

## The Solution

I've made a minimalistic sudoku game board that generates sudoku boards for you to play on, as many as you want.
